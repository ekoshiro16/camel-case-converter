/*
One of your coworkers at the tech company you work at has made a huge error - they have filled up the company's database with strings that are written with dashes and underscores separating each word. That wouldn't be a big deal, except for the fact that your company's entire codebase relies upon the fact that every piece of string data in the company database is written in camel case!

Write a function that takes in a string (you will see examples of it below) and converts it into camel case. 

Note: Camel case is where the first letter of the first word is lowercased, while every subsequent first letter of each other word is uppercased. 

For example,
If your function was given an input like "hello-world-variable",
your function should output "helloWorldVariable"

If your function was given an input like "all cows eat grass", 
your function should output "allCowsEatGrass"

If your function was given an input like "please_excuse_my_dear_aunt_sally",
your function should output "pleaseExcuseMyDearAuntSally"

Note 2: You can always expect that your string input will contain at least 2 words.
Note 3: You can always expect that the words in your string will either be separated by dashes, spaces, or underscores.
